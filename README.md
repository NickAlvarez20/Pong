## Project Name
Pong
## About
The classic Pong game implemented in Python using the built-in Turtle graphics library. This project recreates the original Pong experience where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. It serves as a hands-on learning project to explore interactive graphics and game mechanics in Python.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need Python 3.0+ installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required, as it uses the standard Turtle module for graphics and input handling.
## Features
Pong includes these features:

-Two-player gameplay with keyboard controls (W/S for left paddle, Up/Down arrows for right paddle)

-Realistic ball physics, including bouncing off paddles and walls

-Automatic score tracking displayed on screen

-Game termination when a player reaches 10 points

-Simple, responsive animations using Turtle graphics

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Pong.git`
## Usage
Run the Python script (pong.py) from the command line:
`python pong.py`
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Experience the basics of Turtle graphics for creating interactive 2D applications

-Implement event-driven programming with keyboard inputs for real-time control

-Design a continuous game loop for smooth animations and updates

-Handle collision detection and basic physics simulations

-Structure code using classes for game objects like paddles and the ball
