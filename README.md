The original Pong game using Turtle Project Interpreter.
The main strategy is to return the ball to your opponent as it comes within the range of your paddle. Users must not allow the ball to pass by their paddle or else their opponent will gain a point. The main objective is to pass by your opponent's paddle before they can pass by yours. Players can determine who reaches the agreed upon score first(for example, first player to reach 10 wins) will win the game.
